<h1>Headwater FAQ</h1>
<div class="subhead">Everything you want to know — flavor, function, and how Headwater supports daily performance.</div>

<!-- ================= FAQ BLOCKS ================= -->

<div class="faq-row">
    <div class="question">What is Headwater?</div>
    <div class="answer">
Headwater is a lightly sparkling beverage formulated with Lion’s Mane and Chaga mushroom extracts to support cognitive function and overall physiological resilience. It is designed to promote clear thinking, steady mental performance, and a balanced nervous system, while also supporting cellular protection and a healthy immune response.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-row">
    <div class="question">Why mushrooms?</div>
    <div class="answer">
Lion’s Mane and Chaga contain natural compounds studied for supporting brain communication, cellular protection, and immune balance. Lion’s Mane is associated with pathways involved in learning and memory, and Chaga provides antioxidants and beta-glucans that help the body manage everyday stress.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-row">
    <div class="question">How does it work?</div>
    <div class="answer">
Headwater delivers concentrated Lion’s Mane and Chaga extracts that support key biological systems involved in thinking, stress adaptation, and cellular health.

• Lion’s Mane supports healthy communication between brain cells and pathways linked to memory, learning, and mental clarity.  
• Chaga contains antioxidants and natural polysaccharides that help protect cells from everyday stress and support a healthy immune response.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-row">
    <div class="question">How soon will I notice benefits?</div>
    <div class="answer">
Some people notice a calm, clearer sense of focus early on. More significant benefits tend to build gradually over one to three weeks of consistent use.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-row">
    <div class="question">What will I feel?</div>
    <div class="answer">

    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-row">
    <div class="question">Is this an energy drink?</div>
    <div class="answer">
No. Headwater contains no caffeine and no synthetic stimulants.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-row">
    <div class="question">How is this different from coffee or energy drinks?</div>

Coffee and energy drinks create stimulation and a short-term spike in alertness. Headwater supports steady focus, cognitive endurance, and recovery without over-activating the nervous system or causing a crash.

</div>

<div class="faq-row">
    <div class="question">How is this different from nootropic supplements or powders?</div>
