<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<h3>What is Headwater?</h3>
<p>Headwater is a lightly sparkling beverage formulated with Lion’s Mane and Chaga mushroom extracts to support cognitive function and overall physiological resilience. It is designed to promote clear thinking, steady mental performance, and a balanced nervous system, while also supporting cellular protection and a healthy immune response. The goal isn’t stimulation; it’s to help the brain and body operate efficiently and recover from daily physical and cognitive demands through consistent, nutrition-based support.</p>

<h3>Why mushrooms?</h3>
<p>Lion’s Mane and Chaga contain natural compounds studied for supporting brain communication, cellular protection, and immune balance. Lion’s Mane is associated with pathways involved in learning and memory, and Chaga provides antioxidants and beta-glucans that help the body manage everyday stress. We use these mushrooms for their long-term support of cognitive function and resilience, not for short-term stimulation.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Headwater delivers concentrated Lion’s Mane and Chaga extracts that support key biological systems involved in thinking, stress adaptation, and cellular health.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lion’s Mane</strong> supports healthy communication between brain cells and pathways linked to memory, learning, and mental clarity. Effects build with consistent use and help maintain cognitive performance over time.</li>
<li><strong>Chaga</strong> contains antioxidants and natural polysaccharides that help protect cells from everyday stress and support a healthy immune response, supporting recovery and resilience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Headwater works through steady, nutrition-based support for brain and body systems — not through stimulants or artificial energy spikes.</p>

<!-- BENEFITS -->
<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<h3>How soon will I notice benefits?</h3>
<p>Some people notice a calm, clearer sense of focus early on. More significant benefits tend to build gradually over one to three weeks of consistent use, similar to strength or endurance training. It is designed for steady performance support, not an immediate stimulant effect.</p>

<h3>What will I feel?</h3>
<p>Most people report calm focus, clear thinking, and steady mental energy without jitters or a crash. Benefits often become more noticeable with routine use.</p>

<h3>Is this an energy drink?</h3>
<p>No. Headwater contains no caffeine and no synthetic stimulants. It supports mental performance and physiological balance naturally.</p>

<h3>How is this different from coffee or energy drinks?</h3>
<p>Coffee and energy drinks create stimulation and a short-term spike in alertness. Headwater supports steady focus, cognitive endurance, and recovery without over-activating the nervous system or causing a crash. It helps maintain clarity and resilience rather than producing a jolt.</p>

<h3>How is this different from nootropic supplements or powders?</h3>
<p>Most nootropics rely on isolated compounds or stimulant-based strategies. Headwater uses whole-mushroom extracts to support brain and body systems through nutrition, making it easier to use daily without cycling or managing tolerance.</p>

<h3>Who uses it?</h3>
<p>People who want to support long-term cognitive performance and resilience, including professional athletes, outdoor professionals, creators, students, individuals with high mental demands, and adults 50+ who proactively support healthy cognitive aging.</p>

<!-- USAGE -->
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<h3>When do people drink it?</h3>
<p>Common times include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Morning mental activation</li>
<li>Mid-day for sustained focus</li>
<li>Before training or practice</li>
<li>During long work or study sessions</li>
<li>As part of a daily routine for ongoing brain and immune support</li>
</ul>

<h3>Can I drink it with coffee or tea?</h3>
<p>Yes. Many people drink coffee or tea for immediate alertness and use Headwater for steady cognitive support and nervous-system balance throughout the day.</p>

<h3>How often should I drink it?</h3>
<p>Many people drink Headwater daily. Benefits associated with Lion’s Mane and Chaga are strongest with consistent routine use.</p>

<h3>Can I drink more than one per day?</h3>
<p>Yes. Many people enjoy one to two cans daily depending on their schedule, cognitive load, and training demands.</p>

<h3>Do I need to cycle it?</h3>
<p>No. Headwater isn’t stimulant-based and does not accumulate tolerance. It is intended for continuous use.</p>

<!-- TASTE -->
<h2 id="taste">Taste</h2>

<h3>What does it taste like?</h3>
<p>Light, clean, and crisp with subtle natural fruit flavor — designed for everyday drinkability, not sweetness.</p>

<h3>Does it taste like mushrooms?</h3>
<p>No. Headwater has zero mushroom flavor. The extracts are included for their functional properties, not their taste. Each flavor is clean, crisp, and naturally fruit-forward, with no earthy notes — people are often surprised by how refreshing it is. It tastes like a premium sparkling beverage, not mushrooms, and is crafted to be genuinely enjoyable for daily drinking.</p>

<!-- INGREDIENTS -->
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<h3>Does it contain sugar or sweeteners?</h3>
<p>Headwater is lightly sweetened with 5g of natural agave per can. There are no artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols. The goal is hydration and clean taste, not a sugary flavor profile.</p>

<h3>What else is in it?</h3>
<p>Clean, plant-based ingredients with natural fruit flavor. No artificial sweeteners, preservatives, or chemical additives.</p>

<h3>Do you use real mushroom extracts?</h3>
<p>Yes. We use certified organic fruiting-body extracts rather than mycelium-on-grain. This ensures consistent bioactive content and avoids unnecessary fillers.</p>

<!-- SAFETY -->
<h2 id="safety">Safety</h2>

<h3>Is it safe?</h3>
<p>Lion’s Mane and Chaga are widely used and generally well-tolerated. Those who are pregnant, nursing, on medication, or managing a health condition should consult a healthcare professional.</p>

<h3>Can kids drink it?</h3>
<p>Headwater is formulated for adults. If considering it for minors, consult a pediatric healthcare provider.</p>

<h3>Is it suitable for professional athletes?</h3>
<p>Yes. Headwater contains no banned stimulants and supports neural pathways, antioxidant defenses, and recovery processes important for high-performance lifestyles and training loads.</p>

<h3>Where is it made?</h3>
<p>Produced in the United States with certified organic mushroom extracts and third-party verified ingredients.</p>

<h3>How should I store and drink it?</h3>
<p>Shelf-stable. Best served cold. Refrigerate after opening. No shaking required.</p>

<h3>Is it carbonated?</h3>
<p>Yes. Headwater is gently effervescent — lighter than sparkling water for easy daily drinking.</p>
